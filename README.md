# color-scheme
The Cala Color Scheme - ANSI Color Palette Designed For Maximum Contrast.

## Motivation
Default colors in GTK aren't super easy for me to distinguish (I'm red-green
colorblind).  The built-in alternate themes are even worse, so I made this.
This may additionally be used as the default theme for applications made with
[cala](https://github.com/libcala/cala).

## Goal
A 16-color palette that has easily distinguishable colors for colorblind people,
plus 2 extra unique colors for default background and default foreground.

## Files
- You can see the hexadecimal color values in colorscheme.txt.
- You can use the cala.xml as a Gedit color scheme.
